"In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. Weâ€™ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare."

**Goal**  
The goal in this competition is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is.
For every ImageId in the test set, you should predict the correct label.  

**Metric**  
This competition is evaluated on the categorization accuracy of your predictions (the percentage of images you get correct).
